# Cubibloc
3D - tetris

Cubibloc is a potentiallly fun game. We would like to create a 3D-tetris like, where players can play either with the xOy face or the zOy face with 3D bloc.
Using bonus[/penalty => only in Multiplayer] system as in Tetrinet, we would like to create something that can be playable easily but hard to master.
